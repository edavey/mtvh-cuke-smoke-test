# Smoke testing with Cucumber (and Ruby)

In this Ruby project we use:

- Cucumber to parse Gherkin features
- Capybara to simulate interaction with a browser
- the new 'Apparition' Javascript-capable browser (uses Chrome)

## Getting started

- `git clone`
- use or install Ruby version as per `.ruby-version`. Or change this to suit your setup.
- `bundle install` to install the dependencies defined in `Gemfile`
- `bundle exec cucumber` to run the smoke test
